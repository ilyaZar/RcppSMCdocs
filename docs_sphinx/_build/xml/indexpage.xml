<title>Summary</title>
<para>The SMC template class library (SMCTC) is intended to be used to implement SMC algorithms ranging from simple particle filter to complicated SMC algorithms from simple particle filters to the SMC samplers of Del Moral, Doucet and Jasra (2006) within a generic framework.</para>

<title>Using the Template Library</title>
<para>In order to use the template libary it is necessary to place the set of header files in a suitable include directory and then to instantiate the various classes with the appropriate type for your sampler.</para>
<para>For implementation details, please see the accompanying user guide.</para>

<sect2 id="index_1A">
<title>Simple Particle Filter</title>
<para>This example provides a simple particle filter for the approximate filtering of nonlinear, nongaussian state space models.</para>

<sect2 id="index_1SMC">
<title>Samplers for Rare Event Simulation</title>
<para>The main.cc file provides an example of a use of the template library to estimate Gaussian tail probabilities within an SMC samplers framework by making use of a sequence of intermediate distributions defined by introducing a potential function which varies from flat to being very close to an indicator function on the tail event.</para>
<para>This example is taken from from Johansen, Del Moral and Doucet (2006).</para>
